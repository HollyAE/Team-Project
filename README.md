# Repository Overview:

This repository contains the code for the web application my team and I made for a Team project course during the third year of my degree.

Further details are included within the src folder, including instructions on how to run the application. Unfortunately, I have found a bug when trying to reach the CV-Builder page after running the cloned project. I have attempted to resolve the issue, but I have hit a wall. Apologies, but due to personal time constraints, I most likely won't have this issue fixed before the interview.

Among other tasks, my main technical contribution to the project involved ensuring the web app was responsive for a variety of screen sizes, utilising the framework Tailwind to do so.
